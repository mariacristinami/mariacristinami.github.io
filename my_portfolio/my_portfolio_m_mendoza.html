     Hello there! My name is Maria and I'm from Ecuador. I'm a Political Science major and a Digital Technologies and Emerging Media minor at Fordham University. I love travelling, going to concerts, and hanging out with my friends. I'm currently figuring out what to do after college and exploring the different career paths one can follow after graduation. One thing that I know for sure is that I would like to work somewhere where creativity is valued and communication and technology are used in favor of that.

        This is my hometown, Guayaquil. My favorite thing to do when I'm there is exploring local cafes and stores.
